## üö® Vulnerability Summary

### üî¥ HIGH SEVERITY (3)

#### 1. Expired SSL Certificate
**Evidence:** `testssl.txt` - "Certificate expired (2015-05-25 --> 2025-05-22)"  
**Impact:** Browser security warnings, potential MITM attacks  
**Recommendation:** Renew SSL certificate immediately with trusted CA

#### 2. Self-Signed Certificate
**Evidence:** `testssl.txt` - "Chain of trust: NOT ok (self signed)"  
**Impact:** Browser trust errors for all visitors  
**Recommendation:** Purchase certificate from trusted Certificate Authority

#### 3. Domain Name Mismatch
**Evidence:** `testssl.txt` - "Common Name: web.mmebvba.com" (vs www.itsecgames.com)  
**Impact:** SSL certificate errors  
**Recommendation:** Issue certificate for correct domain name

### üü° MEDIUM SEVERITY (3)

#### 4. Missing Security Headers
**Evidence:** `zap_report.html` & `nikto.txt` - No X-Frame-Options, CSP, X-Content-Type-Options  
**Impact:** Clickjacking, XSS, MIME sniffing attacks  
**Recommendation:** Implement security headers in web server configuration

#### 5. Outdated Drupal 7 CMS
**Evidence:** `nikto.txt` - "Drupal 7 was identified via x-generator header"  
**Impact:** Known CVEs including remote code execution vulnerabilities  
**Recommendation:** Upgrade to supported Drupal version or migrate to modern CMS

#### 6. Deprecated TLS Protocols
**Evidence:** `testssl.txt` - "TLS 1 offered (deprecated)", "TLS 1.1 offered (deprecated)"  
**Impact:** Vulnerable to known cryptographic attacks  
**Recommendation:** Disable TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 in server configuration

### üü¢ LOW SEVERITY (1)

#### 7. Information Disclosure
**Evidence:** `headers.txt` - Server: Apache, ETag information leakage  
**Impact:** Information gathering for attackers  
**Recommendation:** Suppress server banner, remove ETags

## üìä Detailed Findings

### SSL/TLS Issues (Critical)
- Certificate expired since 2015 (10+ years outdated)
- Self-signed certificate (no trusted CA)
- Domain mismatch between certificate and website
- TLS 1.0 and 1.1 protocols enabled (deprecated)

### Web Application Issues
- Drupal 7 CMS identified (end-of-life, no security updates)
- Missing critical security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options)
- Server information disclosure (Apache version)

### Positive Security Controls
- No SQL injection vulnerabilities detected
- No Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities found  
- No Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities identified
- Modern encryption ciphers properly configured

## üéØ Priority Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Critical):
1. **Renew SSL certificate** with trusted CA
2. **Issue correct domain certificate** for www.itsecgames.com

### Short-term Actions (1-2 weeks):
3. **Upgrade from Drupal 7** to supported version
4. **Implement missing security headers**
5. **Disable TLS 1.0 & 1.1** in server configuration

### Security Headers to Implement:
```http
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff  
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
